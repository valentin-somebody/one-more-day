# One More Day - A Daily Commitment to Life  

This repository is a simple yet powerful commitment: every day we overcome dark thoughts, we log it here, until they no longer hold power over us!
Each commit represents a small victory, a conscious choice to keep going.

If you're in a similar situation, you are welcome to join. Fork this repo, create your own log, and track your progress.
Together, we can uplift and motivate each other on our journeys.

## üå± How It Works  

1. **Your Personal Journey**  
   - Create a file under `victories/` with your GitHub username, e.g., `victories/your_username.txt`.

2. **Log Your Progress**  
   - Each time you succeed in fighting negative thoughts, add a new line with the date and anything you'd like to share.
   - Example of a victory file:  
     ```
     2025-01-01: Today is the first day. I made it through.
     2025-01-02: One more day !!
     ```
   - You can commit your progress however you wish, at whatever rhythm you prefer.  
   - There's no need for strict rules‚Äîthis is your personal commitment, so make it meaningful to you!  

3. **Share Your Progress (Optional)**  
   - If you want to share your journey and inspire others, feel free to open a Pull Request!  
   - You can update your victory file and submit a PR when you feel like it.  

## üåç Useful Resources  

We are compiling a list of **mental health resources** by country. 
Feel free to add resources for your country in your native language!  
Simply create a new file under `resources/` (e.g., `resources/germany.md`) and submit a PR.  

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Final Note  

This is a space for small victories, for proving to yourself that you are still here, still fighting.  
If you're struggling, please reach out to someone. You matter, and you are not alone.
